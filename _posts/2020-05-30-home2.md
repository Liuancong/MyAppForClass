## About 
TextExerciser, TE for short, is an iterative, feedback-driven text input exerciser, which dedicates to generating valid text inputs for Android apps. TextExerciser began as a research project at the Fudan University, with the goal of generating text input in dynamic analysis of Android apps. Now it becomes an independent tool that can be used in app testing for bug finding or working together with dynamic analyse tool for sensitive behaviors detection. We have made it publicly available. We hope this project can benefit other researchers or practiontiners. Feel free to [contact](#contact-link) us if you have any questions and issues.
