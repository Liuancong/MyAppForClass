# Demo
Here are some demos to show how TE generates text input based on hints on UI. 
#### Mutate text input based on hints
This demo shows how TE adaptively changes the text input of 'username' in Cram app based on the hints. TE first generates the input 'a' for it which doesn't satisfy the length constraint, i.e. 'Your username must be at least four characters'. Then a proper length input, 'a.G=Z', is given, however it still illformat which leads to dynamic hint, i.e. 'Username must contain only letter, numbers or dashes', shown on screen. Eventually, it changes input to '7bGaZ4', a valid text for this app, and passes current UI page.
