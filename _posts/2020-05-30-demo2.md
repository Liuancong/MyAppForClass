2. Extract verify code
    Here is a demo that TE extracts verify code from SMS. In registration page of Yandex apk, TE first generates text inputs for name, password and provides a valid phone number which is wrote to the config.json file before running for receiving verify code. Then the 'smsOberserver' app running in the real phone will read the SMS inbox and forward the message to TE server module for extracting verify code. Finally, the extracted verify code will be injected to the corresponding text box and the registration process is finished.
