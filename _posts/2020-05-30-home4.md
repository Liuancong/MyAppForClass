### Tool Implementation 
We implement it in python code based on [Uiautomator2](https://github.com/openatx/uiautomator2) to interacte with tested app in phone/emulator, such as fetching dynamic layout information on current UI, exploring the widgets on screen, etc. And a [CNN-RNN Neural Network](https://github.com/jiegzhan/multi-class-text-classiﬁcation-cnn-rnn.) Model is applied to identify and classify hints. We use [Standford NLP](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.html) tools to parser hint texts in *HP* module and [Z3StrSolver](https://sites.google.com/site/z3strsolver/) to solve the input constraints in *IG* module.
Here is the working architecture of TextExerciser tool. The *Real Phone* on the left is used for running the smsOberserver app which transmits the varify code SMS to *PC*. In the middle is the *PC* which executes the main function of TextExerciser. It dynamically triggers the apps installed in *Phones/Emualtors*, generates text input and dispatches varify code.
