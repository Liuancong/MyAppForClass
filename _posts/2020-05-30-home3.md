### TextExerciser WorkFlow
TextExerciser provides a novel approach to automatically generate valid text inputs in testing Android apps. The key insight here is that if a text input does not satisfy the enforced constraints, the Android app will provide clues or hints for the malformed input, which can be used as a feedback for improvement. The workflow of our methodology is as follow :

- UI Exploration(*UIE*) : This module not only drives Android apps to reach different code branches, but also navigates UI to target page, which contains the related text input box, based on hint. 
- Hint Extractor(*HE*) : The main function of *HE* is to extract all the text from UI, then picks out hints via structure-based analysis and learning-based method.
- Hint Parser(*HP*) : *HP* is mainly used for parsering hints and extracting key elements(i.e. constraints) from it. It parses all the extracted hints via three steps: classifying hints into different categories, generating syntax trees for each hint, and interpreting the generated tree into a constraint representation form.
- Input Gneration Engine(*IG*) : In this module, *IG* generates text input based on constraints that shown on current UI or reference from other apps. Specifically, *IG* maps constraints into the solver, and generates a concrete input by solving the problem based on hints. For the hints are too vague to understand by natural language processing, we use cross-app input reference method to process them -- the idea is that we can borrow describable hints from other apps for the same type of inputs. The information of cross-app are stored in 'Input DataBase'.
